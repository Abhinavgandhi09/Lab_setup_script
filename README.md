# Lab_setup_script

This Repository is a work in progress. The aim is to create a shell script that will allow me to replicate my linux setup for work on any computer.


Run the individual scripts to setup the individual software/ repos. You can also string together each script into a single script and run them together. BE careful about interdependencies.

Use the command chmod u+x script_name.sh to modify the script's access.
Then run the script as ./script_name.sh
